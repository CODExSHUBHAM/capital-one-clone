          <p className="text-base font-optimistr">
            One of the most critical aspects of your business is having reliable, accessible communication channels. There’s often no substitute for a voice call to resolve issues, answer complex questions, and deliver the most appropriate response, whether it&apos;s from customers or between you and your teams, especially when remote work is on the rise. Many businesses weigh VoIP (voice over internet protocol) vs. landlines. Which voice call technology is right for your business?
          </p>
          <p className="text-base font-optimistr">
            Another consideration is mobile vs. landline. Mobile phones offer unparalleled flexibility, while landlines and VoIP are both traditional and potentially reliable options. Considering switching from a landline to a mobile service? Read business landlines or cell phones to learn which of these options is best.

          <p className="text-base font-optimistr">
            Considering factors like call quality, mobility, and scalability can help you decide which technology is best for your small business. Read on to learn how VoIP and landlines are different, the modern features of VoIP, and how to compare costs to determine the solution that meets your needs.

          <h1 className="font-optimistl text-[32px]">What is VoIP, what are the benefits, and how does it work?</h1>
          <p className="text-base font-optimistr">
            VoIP is a technology that transmits voice calls over the internet rather than traditional phone lines. Calls are sent digitally as packets of data, which can mean higher quality calls and a slew of other capabilities and features that landlines can’t provide. VoIP requires a high-speed internet connection to work. That connection should be broadband, cable, or fiber, not dial-up.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base font-optimistr">
            VoIP is a service that’s offered by cloud-based providers. These companies route your calls instead of your area telephone company. There is an initial setup to get started, similar to getting landlines installed in your workplace. Once you’re set up, any phone in your office is compatible, such as conference phones and desk phones. You’ll also get access to features that you can’t get from a landline, which we’ll go into more detail about below.
          </p>
          <h1 className="font-optimistl text-[32px]">What are the key differences between VoIP and landlines?</h1>
          <p className="text-base font-optimistr">
            Is VoIP the same as a landline? No, although they do share some basic, fundamental characteristics. With both, you can place and receive calls on a connected phone, using traditional phone numbers. You won’t know the difference between the two when you’re talking.
